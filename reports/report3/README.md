# Introduction

This report entails the details on the measurements strategies that is used to conduct the project, and the statistical and visual analysis of the data at hand.

# Measurement strategies

Given that the data for this research project will be obtained through an Application Programming Interface (API), there is no specific measurement stage required to collect the necessary data. The API will serve as a direct source, providing access to real-time and historical cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin and DOT. This eliminates the need for manual data collection or additional measurement procedures, ensuring a streamlined and efficient data acquisition process. By directly accessing the API, we can ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, enabling a robust analysis and comparison of the LSTM and Neural Prophet models without any measurement-related uncertainties or biases.
