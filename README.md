# Reserach Project: "CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICE FORECASTING: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS WITH OUTLIER HANDLING"

## Problem Significance'

Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a popular investment asset class, attracting attention from individuals and institutions worldwide. However, the volatility and unpredictability of cryptocurrency prices pose significant challenges for investors and traders. Accurate forecasting of cryptocurrency prices can aid in decision-making, risk management, and potential profit generation. Deep learning models have shown promise in capturing complex patterns and dependencies in time-series data, making them suitable for cryptocurrency price prediction. However, there has been a fleet of such models developed to combat this task of time-series forecasting ranging from classical machine learning algorithms, most notably the ARIMA-family models, to more complex statistical, e.g. prophet by META, and deep learning models. The primary goal of this project is to study the various techniques that have been developed so far with, on publicly available data to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis. It should also be noted that heavy emphasis will be placed on deep learning models.

Furthermore, the presence of outliers in cryptocurrency data can affect the performance and accuracy of these models. Therefore, investigating the impact of outlier removal on the performance of deep learning models for cryptocurrency price prediction is crucial to improve the reliability and usefulness of such predictions. It is for this reason that the secondary objective of this study is to apply different outlier detection and removal techniques and  analyze the impact on the tested models.

Last, but not least, I am planning to analyze the interpretability and visualization of the inner layers of these models to gain insights into their predictive power.
