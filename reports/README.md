Weekly report as of 08/06/22 (dd/mm/yy)

# Week 3
This weeks main focus has been identifying the most suitable dataset for the project. I have been able to identify a dataset that is available for free and is updated every minute. The dataset is available at https://tradingstrategy.ai and is a 1 minute aggregation of the market data across any cryptocurrency token with its USD equivalent.
However, the dataset is not available for download and can only be accessed via an API. I have been able to successfully access the API and download the a portion of the necessary data in JSON format.

On the other hand, I have also been able to contact the responsible people at my workplace to get access to the data that I need. I was able to get a positive response and will be able to access the data. In terms of citing the data, I will be advised on this matter in the coming week.
